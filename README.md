Atomic and Molecular Cluster Studies](https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2019.00707)

*cluster: an assembly of atoms that is an intermediate between a simple
molecule and a nanoparticle*

This program utilizes a genetic algorithm to approximate the structure of Lennard Jones (LJ) 
clusters given the number of particles. It produces an .xyz file containing the final positions of the particles
in the cluster.
